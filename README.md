#ipfs-music
A peer-to-peer music streaming application built upon IPFS.

# Goals
- A Spotify-like application for playing music files. 
- Built in search for playing music available on a peer-to-peer network (a l√† Napster or Soulseek). 

# Stack
* Electron
* React
* Apollo Client
* [Howler](https://howlerjs.com)
* TailwindCSS
* IPFS/WebTorrent
  * trying both as I was initially having trouble with IPFS at the time.  I think IPFS would have been the way to go however as I could not quite get WebTorrent to work.

## IPFS
- Spin up an IPFS node and host their music on the IPFS network when the user selects their own library
- Provide a separate web service with a searchable list of songs and their IPFS hashes (legally dubious).

## WebTorrent
- Load WebTorrent, connect to a private tracker and seed their music to the other peers using the application. Pretty much the same functionality as the IPFS version
- Provide a separate web service with a searchable list of songs and their magnet links (especially legally dubious).  

## Getting around the legally dubious?
Hosting a web service that indexes IPFS hashes for MP3s seems a little less legally dubious than hosting magnet links. It's still dubious. To avoid any legal responsibility the idea was to eventually have a distributed database (or perhaps a serialized data structure downloaded from the P2P network on load) that would provide the data needed to index and search hashes locally.

# What is working?
Recalling how some of this worked back in 2019...

1. User loads application and sets their music directory in settings. Settings are saved in a file locally (no user accounts for privacy).
2. The application analyzes all of the files using `music-metadata`. Any non-music files are ignored. Music files are cached locally and displayed in a list in the application.
3. Users can play their own files locally with Pause/Play controls.

## WIP
- During development a hardcoded IPFS hash (or torrent magnet link) was used. I also had a local development setup for IPFS nodes (and later bittorrent tracker) for mocking the environment where the user would stream music from a torrent.  The P2P library would load the file as and stream it to the user as if it was locally. This was mostly working but was having issues. This is where I left off.
